ðŸ“Œ TodoGemini-App

This project was developed based on the information I learned in the Google Artificial Intelligence and Technology Academy training. This is a To-Do management application integrated with Gemini AI. It was developed using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy. Users can add, edit and delete their tasks by logging in with JWT authentication. In addition, task descriptions can be automatically detailed with Gemini AI support.
